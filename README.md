# Where Did It All Start:
Pantry made list on apple notes, and tasked to do some inventory work to know how much of everything we had. 

## Frustrations:
1. Counting While People Shopping
2. Inventory changed to quick to recount items
	- Items donated and picked up simultaneously all the time
3. Not All Categories Existed
4. Forced to cap number after certain amount--"50+--to speed up counting but lacked precision
## Why It Could Work
- Check-ins were required regardless for folks dropping off or picking up inventory. This check-in system could be intertwined with the inventory counter to help others update the list--real-time. 
- Helps the inventory team massively while it's an incremental change for those checking in
	- The workload could even be pushed towards pick-up/drop-off clients enumerating their items while on check-out/check-in


## Scope:
**Needs:**
1. Collaborative, multiple people can contribute to this at the same time
2. Real-time updates
3. Select Item then fill in how many given/received
4. Elastic Category Customization

**Wants:**
1. Ability to search for category or item names 
2. Solving the problem of certain items coming in bulk or having multiple of same item in one box, thus misleading data on how many there are
